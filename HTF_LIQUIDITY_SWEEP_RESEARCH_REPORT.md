# HTF_LIQUIDITY_SWEEP_RESEARCH_REPORT.md — htf_liquidity_sweep_bos_fvg verdict

**Date: 2026-07-09. Campaign 5 of the scalp/intraday edge search.**
Family requested by the owner: HTF liquidity sweep → 5m BOS / inverse-FVG
confirmation → 1m BOS execution trigger → TP at the opposite-side liquidity
draw (ICT/SMC multi-timeframe model).

**Definitive verdict: NO-GO — all 14 pre-registered cells net-negative after
cost; 11 of 14 cells negative even BEFORE cost.** The multi-timeframe
confirmation stack (5m BOS/IFVG + 1m trigger) does not rescue the
liquidity-sweep family that already failed in campaigns 1–3 as a single-TF
rule (holdout −0.38R) and in campaign 4 as prior-day sweep-reclaim (−0.32R).
Zero of 12 coins positive in the base cell; both time halves negative in
every cell; every acceptance criterion fails.

## Protocol (identical to campaigns 1–4)

- Real Binance USDT-M **1m** klines from `data.binance.vision`, 24 months
  (2024-07 → 2026-06), 12 validated coins (BTC ETH SOL BNB XRP DOGE ADA
  AVAX LINK TON TRX DOT), 1,051,200 bars/coin, gapless. 5m/1h/4h frames
  resampled from the same 1m data (execution and signal frames exactly
  consistent).
- Signals on CLOSED bars only; market entries at the NEXT 1m open; limit
  entries fill only on a later touch of the resting level. No lookahead
  (spot-verified trade-by-trade).
- Conservative fills: stop-first when a 1m bar touches both stop and target.
- Costs in R against the actual stop distance: taker 0.045% + slip 0.02%
  per side (0.13% RT); resting-limit entries maker 0.02% + taker exit
  (0.085% RT). Sub-5bp stops discarded as untradeable.
- One position per symbol (no overlapping trades), setup cancelled if price
  closes back through the sweep extreme before confirmation.
- Split-half time OOS (H1 discovery / H2 confirm), kill-rule: H2 ≤ 0 kills.
- DSR via the engine's `deflated_sharpe` at the campaign-wide trial count
  **161** (147 prior book trials + 14 cells here).
- Not modeled (stated limitations): news-window avoidance (no offline
  calendar); order-book spread beyond the flat slippage charge — both would
  only make results *worse* or reduce trade count.

## Strategy implementation (as specified)

1. **HTF liquidity map** — previous UTC day H/L; previous completed Asia
   (00–08), London (08–13), NY (13–21) session H/L; last 10 unswept 1h
   pivot(k=3) swings per side; last 6 4h pivot swings per side ("major
   pools"); equal highs/lows = two 1h pivots within 0.1×ATR1h merged to one
   EQH/EQL level. Levels die when swept (wick through + close back) or
   broken (close through).
2. **Sweep** — 5m high > level & close back below ⇒ buy-side sweep, short
   bias (mirror for longs). One setup per bar/side, outermost level tags it.
3. **5m confirmation** (≤ 2h window) — BOS = close through the most recent
   confirmed 5m pivot(k=2) structure; IFVG = close through the far edge of
   the most recent opposing FVG formed into the sweep. No confirmation → no
   trade.
4. **1m trigger** (≤ 1h window) — 1m close through the prior 10-bar
   structure extreme. Entry variants: market at next open / limit at the
   broken structure (retest) / limit at the 1m displacement-FVG mid.
5. **Stops** — behind sweep wick / behind 15-bar 1m structure / behind the
   confirming IFVG far edge (each + 0.1×ATR5m buffer).
6. **TP** — nearest opposite-side liquidity level with RR ∈ [1.5, 12]
   (minimum-RR & minimum-liquidity-distance filter; no target → no trade) /
   fixed 2R / TP1 50% @1R + stop-to-BE runner to the liquidity draw.
   Time-stop 4h.
7. **Filters** — session subsets (Asia / London / NY), 4h SMA50
   trend-alignment variant.

docstring); data fetcher `scripts/fetch_1m_klines.py`.

MaxDD is reported in R on the merged chronological sequence; at any live
sizing a negative-expectancy path is ruin, so the DD line only matters for
the (non-existent) positive cells.

## Required comparisons

- **BOS-only vs IFVG vs BOS+IFVG** (C0/A1/A2): statistically identical net
  (−0.24 / −0.25 / −0.24R). IFVG confirms ~3× more setups but adds no
  quality; requiring both filters trades without improving expectancy.
- **1m trigger vs 5m trigger** (C0 vs B1): identical (−0.239 vs −0.232R).
  The 1m stage neither improves entry price enough to matter nor filters
  losers.
- **Market vs limit vs FVG-mid entry** (C0/B2/B3): limit entries are the
  best variants in the family (−0.178 / −0.199R) because maker fees cut
  cost drag from 0.195R to ~0.14R — but gross is −0.05R, so nothing exists
  for the cheaper execution to save.
- **Liquidity-target TP vs fixed-R vs partials** (C0/E1/E2): fixed 2R is
  least bad (−0.180R) purely because it exits sooner; the liquidity-draw
  thesis ("price runs to the opposite pool") adds nothing measurable; the
  TP1/TP2/runner model raises winrate to 45.6% but its clipped winners
  (avgW 0.68R) lower expectancy further.
- **Stops**: wider = better here only because cost-in-R shrinks; the tight
  1m-structure and IFVG-invalidation stops are catastrophic (−0.41/−0.49R,
  cost drag 0.36–0.45R) — the exact cost-floor mechanism documented in
  `SCALP_EDGE_RESEARCH_REPORT.md`.
- **Sessions**: London is the least bad (gross +0.007R — the only
  gross-positive slice) but still −0.20R net; Asia worst (gross −0.094R).
  No session rescues the family; no over-concentration question arises
  because nothing is positive.
- **Trend filter** (G1): improves gross to −0.013R while halving trades —
  directionally sensible, still dead.

## Base-cell breakdowns (n, net R, t)

- **Session**: asia 601, −0.279 (−6.2) · london 559, −0.202 (−3.7) ·
  ny 698, −0.212 (−4.7) · off-hours 387, −0.280 (−4.8).
- **Side**: long 1,112, −0.246 (−7.2) · short 1,133, −0.233 (−6.4) —
  symmetric failure.
- **Coin**: all 12 negative; best DOGE −0.083 (−0.9), worst TRX −0.566
  (−6.3). BTC −0.229, ETH −0.119, SOL −0.218, XRP −0.147, BNB −0.245,
  ADA −0.158, AVAX −0.190, LINK −0.313, TON −0.329, DOT −0.254.
- **Sweep type**: pd −0.350 (−5.2) · sess_asia −0.331 (−5.2) ·
  sess_london −0.307 (−4.5) · sess_ny −0.324 (−5.6) · sw1h −0.131 (−3.3) ·
  eq −0.052 (n=29) · **sw4h +0.196 (n=30, t=0.9)** — the only positive
  slice in the campaign: 30 trades, not significant, and a 0.04
  trades/day sub-slice of an already-failed family; under the 161-trial
  deflation this is exactly the noise the kill-rule exists for.

## Why it fails (same structural wall as campaigns 1–4)

The confirmation stack works as designed — the spot-checked trades sweep a
real level, break structure, trigger and sometimes run 3R to the opposite
pool. But across 2,245 base trades the signal has **no gross alpha**
(−0.045R before ANY cost), i.e. post-sweep direction at the 5m/1m horizon
is a coin flip with adverse selection, and the 0.13–0.45R cost drag then
buries it. This family was the last plausible variant of the
sweep-reversal thesis (single-TF versions failed in campaigns 1, 3 and 4);
the multi-TF ICT/SMC dressing changes which trades are taken, not what
they earn. **Scalp remains closed** — the reopening conditions are
unchanged: L2/tick order-flow data + latency infra, or a several-times
lower fee regime.

Campaign-wide trial count after this wave: **161**.
